👋 **Welcome to Meteor Development!**

📋 **Single Entry Point**: Read docs/procs/PROCESS.txt for complete workflow

🎯 **Quick Start** (5 minutes to productive work):
1. Read docs/procs/PROCESS.txt ← Master workflow guide (3 min read)
2. Read docs/procs/CONTINUE.md ← Current session status (1 min read)

⚡ **Ultra-Fast Start** (30 seconds):

🏗️ **RSB Integration Requirements**:
→ Any RSB feature usage MUST have corresponding sanity tests
→ See docs/ref/RSB_CLI_FEATURES.md for integration patterns
→ Use docs/ref/HOWTO_HUB.md for dependency management

🔍 **System Health Check**:
→ Run ./bin/validate-docs.sh to verify documentation integrity
→ Run ./bin/test.sh sanity to validate all tests pass
→ Test CLI: cargo run --bin meteor parse "ctx=app; ui:button=click"

📁 **All Process Documents Located in docs/procs/**
